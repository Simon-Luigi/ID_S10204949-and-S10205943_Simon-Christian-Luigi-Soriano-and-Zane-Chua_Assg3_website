<h2>Design Process</h2>


<h2>Features</h2>
There is a variety of features that have been "gamified" to make it visually and functionally pleasing for users to give them a unique shopping experience while allowing them to navigate through the website smoothly. Other features are also used in order to allow the site to run as intended to.

1. The use of javascript to allow us to gather data from 4 fake shopping databases that we have created using over 30+ unique data.
2. A shopping cart feature that saves all of the users choices and displays all of the items that the user has chosen from browsing from the different online stores and users can earn tokens when confirming their purchase in this feature.
3. A Gachapon (Japanese vending machine) system that allows users to use their tokens to spin it and win vouchers to give them discounts on their next purchase.
4. Responsive clickable content so that it makes it easier for users to know where to navigate to.
