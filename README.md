<h2>Design Process</h2>
We created the website with the intention of making a "gamified" e-commerce system to attract potential online shoppers and give them a unique shopping experience. By gathering data from many different online stores, this website also serves as a one-stop place for users to shop from various online shopping websites through the use of this website alone, making shopping more convenient for users. With a "gamified" yet friendly user interface system, users will be relieved to find out how easily they can navigate through the website. This website also features a Japanese vending machine system, or Gachapon, which allows users to spend their tokens which they can earn from purchasing anything using this third-party website to earn vouchers which can be used for future purchases.


Before creating this website, we had to think of a website design that would be suitable to users as we want to make the process from the start, which is the landing page of the website, to finish when they make their purchase. We also had to think of a theme that would be visually pleasing towards most users. We were then struck with inspiration from a mobile game that both Zane and Simon have played, which is Guardian Tales. Guardian Tales is a pixel mobile game with beautiful graphics and user interface, and we have received inspiration from its home page when a user enters the game, which is a floating-island that is sprung with greenery and various rustic buildings that fits its medieval theme. Thus, we decided to create a floating island that holds various shopping sites and this will give users a positive feeling when viewing the sky island. 


Further gathering inspiration from guardian tales, we decided to make the theme of the website to be a pixel-like fantasy where it gives users a feeling of playing a pixel fantasy game. We decided to create 4 mock online shop databases and painstakingly filled it with data of our own using RestDb to store and retrieve data from it. By doing so, it allows us to give users an idea of what our website is capable of doing, which is to collaborate with the many e-commerce websites using their API. All of our designs are original, from the icon of the website when users first enter it, to the logos of the mock shops that we have created. This is what we have decided to do as it helps fit our theme of a pixel-like e-commerce website.

<h2>Features</h2>
There is a variety of features that have been "gamified" to make it visually and functionally pleasing for users to give them a unique shopping experience while allowing them to navigate through the website smoothly. Other features are also used in order to allow the site to run as intended to.

1. The use of javascript to allow us to gather data from 4 mock shopping databases that we have created using over 30+ unique data.
2. A shopping cart feature that saves all of the users choices and displays all of the items that the user has chosen from browsing from the different online stores and users can earn tokens when confirming their purchase.
3. A Gachapon (Japanese vending machine) system that allows users to use their tokens to spin it and win vouchers to give them discounts on their next purchase.
4. Responsive clickable content so that it makes it easier for users to know where to navigate to.
5. Usage of LocalStorage to store token / voucher inventory locally on the user's device which will be saved whenever user return to the web on that device.
